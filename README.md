# heart-disease-analysis
📊 Overview
This project involves an in-depth analysis of a heart disease dataset to uncover insights, visualize trends, and identify key factors contributing to heart disease. The goal is to demonstrate data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the ability to derive actionable insights from healthcare data.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

CSV Dataset (Heart Disease UCI dataset or similar)

🔍 Key Objectives
Understand and clean the dataset

Perform univariate and multivariate analysis

Visualize distributions and correlations

Identify key features affecting heart disease risk

Present insights through data storytelling

📈 Insights Derived
Age, cholesterol levels, chest pain type, and maximum heart rate achieved are significant indicators.

A strong correlation was observed between ST depression and heart disease presence.

Visuals such as heatmaps and pair plots helped in understanding patterns and relationships.

✅ Outcome
This project helped me strengthen my EDA skills and understand how data-driven decisions can be made in the healthcare domain. It can serve as a foundation for building predictive models in the future.
